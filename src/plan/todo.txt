Code the service layer
Figure out better error handling => have error partial in certain views for more clarity
add additional information to necessary routes/views
add additional timestamp information to necesary tables
Revisit display => probably separate into multiple views for all/individual
Create script to enter in default/basic data

additional functionality:
configure locations
locations are in a grid format => calculate distances and assign tasks based on distances
add fake workers that automatically complete tasks to a set KPI
